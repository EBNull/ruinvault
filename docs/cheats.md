# Cheats

## Moon

- `H` to heal character

## Translations

Translation cheats can only be used during the spacing phase of the game.

- `C` to cheat fully (and solve the translation).
- `I` to insert each word into a single correct slot position. This is equivilent to `C` unless there are duplicates.

### Debug Cheats

Generally not useful. Using these during the disambiguation phase can result in missing glyphs or a softlocked game.

- `O` to randomly cross out a word during the sentence spacing phase, possibly a correct one. 
- `U` to remove all words from slots, even those you already know for sure. This can easily softlock you.
